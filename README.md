I envisioned a stylized Tesla Cybertruck using basic geometric shapes. I planned to use rectangles for body, triangles for roof, and ellipses for wheels. During drawing process, canvas is set to 500x500 with a greenish background(background(180,200,132)). A light grey rectangle forms car body. Two stacked triangles (one light, one dark) create a windshield effect. Black and dark blue ellipses form tires and inner wheels, giving a layered appearance. Additional small rectangles on car edges resemble headlights and signal lights

(explaination before, during, after process, colors, and etc, minimum 150 words)
Before animation starts, canvas is set up with a white background and no outlines for shapes. Variables cream, cone1, cone2, and cone3 define initial positions of ice cream cone. During the animation, ice cream slowly descends (with using if). Both movements are controlled by variable values that increase with each frame. Ice cream then reaches ground and appears to melt. Brown ovals (ellipse(80,355,50,5); ellipse(210, 360, 200, 10);) are drawn to simulate puddles of melted ice cream on the surface, giving animation a fun and realistic final touch

Before starting, I planned to design a playful, alien Mike Wazowski creature using basic shapes and colors in p5.js. During the process, I built character step-by-step: first horns, then head, eyes, arms, legs, and added animated movement to pupil using a direction variable and a conditional boundary check to create a simple eye-tracking effect. I used noStroke() for a cleaner cartoon look, and rectangles for body parts and fingers. After finishing alien comes to life with smooth motion in eye, which moves left and right between set bounds (185–215). Shapes and symmetry help maintain balance, while the bouncing pupil adds interactivity and personality

Sketch sets up a full-window canvas and defines a grid size of 60 pixels. Color mode is set to HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) for more intuitive color variation. The noStroke() function ensures that shapes have no outlines, giving a clean visual style. During Execution: drawPattern() function fills the canvas with a grid of shapes. Each cell randomly displays either a circle or a square, filled with a randomly chosen hue (0–360), and fixed saturation (80) and brightness (90). This creates a vibrant, colorful mosaic. The background is set to a soft off-white (HSB: 0,0,95). After Interaction: When the user clicks the mouse, the pattern is regenerated with new random shapes and colors in each cell, offering a dynamic and interactive visual experience every time. Use of HSB colors helps maintain visual harmony while still allowing a wide range of color variation


Act 6: Typography

I planned to create a typographic animation where phrase "code is poetry" appears as dots that gently wave like a sine wave, emphasizing fluid and creative nature of coding. I chose a monospaced font (SourceCodePro) for a clean, structured look. During the coding phase, textToPoints() function was used to convert text into an array of coordinates. Then, in draw() loop, I used sin() function to animate vertical position of each dot over time, creating a wave effect. After completing  sketch, I observed rhythmic motion and adjusted wave amplitude and frame speed (angle = angle + 6) for a smooth, hypnotic animation. Result is a visually engaging typographic piece that blends motion, color, and code echoing message that "code is poetry


Act 7: Mouse Trails

Setup() function initializes the canvas with a size of 600x400 pixels and sets the background color to black (0). This prepares a dark stage for the animation. During the draw() loop, a semi-transparent black rectangle (fill(0,15)) is drawn over the entire canvas on each frame. This gradually fades previous drawings, creating a trailing effect. Then, a cyan colored circle (fill(0,255,255)) follows the mouse pointer. After some movement, the canvas displays a glowing trail effect that visualizes the path of the cursor dynamically using color and transparency



Act 9: Data Visualization

I prepared three arrays: one for programming language names, one for their popularity percentages, and another for RGB color values for each bar. During execution, setup() creates a 600x400 pixel canvas with a light gray background. Mapped to a bar height using map() function, so larger percentages appear taller. Using rect() function, colorful vertical bars are drawn based on custom RGB values from colors array. For example, Python's bar is a vibrant pink [255, 99, 132], while JavaScript gets an orange tone [255, 159, 64]. Text labels show both percentage above each bar and language name below it, helping users easily identify each data point. After rendering, result is a clear, colorful bar chart titled “Popular Programming Languages”, positioned at top. Chart successfully communicates which languages are most widely used, using color and layout to enhance readability and engagement
